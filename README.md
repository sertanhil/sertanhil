### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I completed Istanbul Kultur University Civil Aviation and Transportation Management associate degree in 2018-2020. I got my first work experience as an Operations position as an Inditex employee in the 2018-2020 study. I am currently studying 1st year Aviation Management at Anadolu University.

I care about keeping good team relations and doing my job diligently, and my priority is to work solution-oriented.
